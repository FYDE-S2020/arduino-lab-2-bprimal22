## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

    For unique identification  of source and destination in the Internet

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

    DNS converts domain names to IP addresses. The largest benefit of using domain name instead of IP address is that it is easier to remember domain names.

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

    Static IP doesn't change whereas Dynamic IP address changes.

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    TCP: connection oriented, connection in byte stream, doesn't support multitasking and broadcasting
    UDP: connection-less, connection in messege form, supports broadcasting

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

    We can't use the delay function because it uses interrupts (is event based).

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    Nothing else runs when a function is running.

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    because you don't have to poll. Other functions can run while not interrupted.

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   Interface defines what an object can do. An implementation implements an interface.
   It is important because we implement the functions in the library.
